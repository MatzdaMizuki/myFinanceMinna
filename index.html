                        How often do you check your bank account? <br>
                        Do you experience negative surprises or panic when you look at it? <br>
                        Are you a financial firefighter? <br> 
                        The last thing you want to look at every day is your bank account…<br><br>
                        But if you are anxious about money, you will constantly think about it.<br>
                        Or are you an ostrich?<br>
                        Sticking your head into the sand and rarely, if ever, looking at your financial situation holistically and how to make the most of it and become financially free?<br><br>
                        If you are currently in a “luxury situation” with a great income, it is easy to just live your life and not worry about it, even if most of the money you receive quickly disappears somewhere…<br>
                        When things are going well for you, that is the best time to develop your long-term strategy and put it into action. <br>
                        So that you’re prepared when something happens.<br><br>
                        The biggest mistake is, we think we have time.

                        I read probably 15-20 books on investing and financial management per year. Why?<br>

                        This was not supposed to happen to me. How could I be so stupid?<br>
                        I had studied Finance and Economics, I had an MBA from a great university, I was working at one of the world’s top management consultancies, McKinsey, coveted by thousands of applicants each year.
                        But I had not done ANY investments for myself. Nobody ever told me to start investing at business school. In my family nobody invested. And I never took the time to learn to do it myself.
                        Yes, it’s kind of embarrassing. But what really got me upset were the MISSED OPPORTUNITIES. Had I started to invest when I was younger – even just 100 Euros a month – the power of compound interest would have built me a solid financial foundation to use as I like.
                        It’s not that I had any real difficulties in life. I have been very lucky. My husband and I had well paying jobs, but the money just came in and went out. No investing, no long-term perspective, no wealth building.
                        And then something happened.

                        The DREAM home. The one with the big terrace, where a view of the Swiss Alps invites to go hiking. With lovely wooden floors. Where we see our kids’ kindergarten from the window. 
                        When we first visited, I felt instantly at home and saw myself there, walking in slippers, with my coffee cup in my hand.
                        Me and my husband were 38 years old and realized that we had the opportunity of a lifetime to buy our dream home. 
                        We had been looking for years.<br>
                        But we did not know if we could afford the down payment.
                        We had to scrape together every penny of cash we had, and it was still not enough.<br>
                        We went to speak with various advisors who sent us in different directions. 
                        After months of painful work, uncertainty, stress and calculations at night, we managed to find a solution, but had to pledge all our pension savings.<br>

                        It was a humbling experience. 
                        And I decided then and there to take control of our finances, so we would always know where we stand, and to put our money to work.
                        I learned a LOT from this experience. <br>
                        I realized that financial wellbeing gives you freedom, security and more options.<br>
                        And secondly, it is not easy to do this (organizing finances and investing), even if you are from the industry. 
                        It takes time, reading, thinking, going through your life’s matters. 
                        Sometimes you and your partner are not on the same page. There are complications.<br>
                        And that’s why it’s easier to push it to a later time, even if we know how important it would be.<br>
                        In retrospect, going through this was one of the best things that happened to me.
                        And that’s why, I’m here today.
                        I want to pass those lessons on to you and help you through your own journey to financial wellbeing.
