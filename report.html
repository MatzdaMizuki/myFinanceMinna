    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <section>
        <p>The website is dedicated to promoting financial wellbeing for women. Many women, even those with substantial earnings, are not investing. A common reason cited for not investing is a lack of time and fear of the associated risks. But if we shift our perspective, we realize there's a risk in not investing too: the devaluation of savings due to inflation.</p>
        
        <p>Financial wellbeing is about more than just money; it's about freedom. Freedom from jobs or partners that may not align with one's ideal life. It's crucial to understand and steadily work towards achieving this form of wellbeing, and that's the message we aim to convey through our website.</p>
