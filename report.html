            While this began as a student project for a Web Development course, it materialized into a genuine business endeavor. My client, Minna Schmidt, recently launched her career as a Financial Advisor after dedicating 15 years to prestigious firms like McKinsey & Company and Blackrock. Instead of traditional newsletters, Minna has chosen to utilize Instagram to convey her professional insights and messages, emphasizing the importance of investments. Her primary target audience is women, whom she aims to empower towards achieving financial well-being. Additionally, Minna had previously compiled a "brochure" using PowerPoint, which was saved as a PDF. The primary objective of this project was to transform the content of this brochure into a cohesive website. One of the site's pages is specifically designed to showcase an archive of her Instagram posts, serving as a modernized newsletter.
        </div>

                <h4>Purpose of the website</h4>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    This website offers Financial Well-Being Coaching for women. Minna, the financial coach, assists women in creating their "balance sheet", enabling a comprehensive understanding of their entire financial situation. This includes guidance on effectively managing monthly and yearly financial flows. Surprisingly, numerous women, even those in high-paying roles, have not embarked on their investment journeys and often find parts of their finances in disarray. This website primarily promotes a 6-week coaching program while providing useful information such as resources for self-study and a newsletter archive to rectify these issues and empower women towards financial independence.

                        <span class="lead">Home</span>
                        <p>
                            The homepage will welcome visitors with a strong message emphasizing the significance of investing and the core value of financial well-being. Just below the viewport (commonly referred to as "below the fold"), there will be three prominent action buttons: "Read my Newsletter", "Book the Free Intro Session", and "Reserve a Seat for the Course". These buttons will be placed towards the bottom of the page to ensure they are easily accessible without appearing too pushy to the visitor. Moreover, these action buttons also serve as an "index" or guide to other sections of the site. This feature is particularly beneficial for mobile users where the primary navigation is hidden under a hamburger menu, allowing them to quickly discern the site's key offerings even if they aren't directly highlighted on the homepage.

                        <p>
                            This page delves into my client's personal journey, highlighting her epiphany about the significance of investment when she and her husband embarked on the journey to purchase their dream home. Additionally, to maintain a concise layout, various testimonials from contented clients are presented in a carousel format. Positioned at the page's bottom is the "free intro chat" integrated with Calendly. This allows users interested in taking the next step to instantly view my client's availability and schedule a conversation.

                        <span class="lead">Resource</span>
                        <p>
                            My client had previously curated a list of recommended resources, including books, podcasts, and websites, which she shared with past clients. She once mentioned in her brochure: "There are two paths to financial well-being - either access my resource list for free and learn independently, or seek my assistance." Now, rather than sending a PDF via email, this resource list is accessible on a dedicated webpage. This page caters to those who might opt for self-study over enrolling in courses, offering an assortment of resources to enhance their financial knowledge. Each item is conveniently linked to platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Amazon. Presenting these materials in an organized manner, depending on their type, is an approach I've adopted from the Harvard Business Review.

                        <p>
                            My client provides daily insights via Instagram, aiming to continually remind women of the significance of their financial well-being. Some posts feature video messages, while others present powerpoint cards, all complemented by in-depth articles. Two pivotal Instagram posts have been spotlighted in the "Most Popular" section of this page. The first outlines her "Mission," detailing what she aims to accomplish through her course. The second, titled "Are you an expat?", underscores her unique value as a financial advisor with an international perspective; a reflection of her diverse clientele.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Given the increasing preference for audiovisual content over written text, I've included the original videos for these two highlighted posts. Other articles can be found in the "Archive" section. These posts are arranged chronologically, with the most recent content at the forefront, and they are further organized using a topic-based filter system such as "investing," "well-being," "mission," and "collaboration." Clicking on the "read more" button redirects the user to the detailed post on the financial coach's Instagram page.
                        </p>

                        <span class="lead">Course</span>
                        <p>
                            This section provides a comprehensive overview of the courses designed to bolster women's financial management capabilities. The spotlight is on a 6-week course that's divided into five detailed sessions, each detailing learning outcomes and setting clear expectations. The structure of the course is visually represented using a Bootstrap card style and grid layout. Positioned below the fold is the "Reserve a seat" section. Adopting a similar approach to the "Book intro chat" on the "Our story" page and the three action buttons on the index page, we've placed this call-to-action at the bottom to ensure it doesn't come across as overly aggressive. I've integrated Formspree, so when a reader clicks submit, it triggers an email to my client.

                        Harvard Business Review, which is the pinnacle of academic newsletters, inspires me for two reasons. 
                        Upon first impression, its clean and conservative design (white background, quiet font) paired with striking images caught my attention. 
                        we too opted for a minimalist color palette and sourced captivating images from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>.

                        The podcast “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” by Ramit Sethi offers financial advice in an entertaining manner. This is achieved by sharing relatable stories from couples who participate in his coaching sessions, complemented by the host's enthusiastic communication style. The website mirrors this engaging, story-telling approach with its punchy expressions, efficient use of space, and large-size images ensures readers engaged.

                        "Invest like Aisha" is helmed by a Swiss-based financial advisor catering to female clients. Her personal story is both heartbreaking and compelling: her husband tragically died in a car accident the day before she was expecting to give birth to her second child. Facing the uncertainty of maintaining her lifestyle, her experience highlights the critical importance of personal financial management.   It's a poignant reminder that even with a comfortable income today, we must always be prepared for unforeseen circumstances where we might be unable to work, necessitating our savings to sustain us. Moreover, her proactive use of YouTube videos, as seen in "watch my first class", provides an impression of her being action-oriented.

                        Using the web accessibility evaluation tool, <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a>, I've corrected all the errors to ensure strong color contrast and appropriate alternative text for images.

                    <p class="m-2 p-2">
                        For the link descriptions, I have avoided using generic link texts such as “click here” or “read more.” Instead, I have opted for descriptive texts that clearly convey the purpose of each link. For instance, on the newsletter page, the button reads “Read more on Instagram.” Similarly, on the resource page, the button for recommended books states “View details on Amazon.”

                        To enhance accessibility for visually impaired users, I have employed the &lt;button&gt; tag combined with an event listener instead of the &lt;a&gt; tag. This methodology enables browsers to appropriately highlight the buttons. When users press "Enter", they are navigated to the designated link. I have instituted this approach on the Resources page, which contains links to recommended books, podcasts, and websites. In a similar vein, on the newsletter page, the "read more in Instagram" buttons—generated dynamically for each article via JavaScript—utilize the &lt;button&gt; tag as opposed to &lt;a&gt;.

                    <p>
                        For layout design, I've utilized Bootstrap's flex design with a column breakpoint for large screens. 
                        For instance, on the index page and the "Contact Us" page, an image and a paragraph are positioned next to each other, each occupying 50% of the space. However, in the mobile view, both the image and paragraph expand to take the full width. Similarly, on the "Course" and "Resource" pages, I've employed a card design. 
                        In the web view, three cards are displayed horizontally, but in the mobile view, each card expands to take up 100% of the width.

                    <p>
                        In order to present detailed information without causing the website page length to become excessively long, I implemented a carousel for the "What My Clients Say" section. As of now, my client has three high-quality, lengthy testimonials. With the anticipation that more testimonials will be added in the future, this design choice ensures that the webpage remains uncluttered. Similarly, for the details of the "6 Weeks Course", I've used accordion styling. By default, only the first item is open, but users have the option to click and view other items. This approach keeps the page compact while still providing all necessary information.

                    <p>
                        For pages abundant in content, such as the index page—which features four articles on financial wellbeing before introducing the registration section—and the courses page, which starts with a featured six-week course encompassing three articles about the program before listing other courses, I've established a sub-navigation system. This enables users who are specifically interested in the second item or subsequent sections to jump to them quickly, enhancing the user experience.

                    <p class="text-muted m-2 p-2">
                        Firstly, I undertook this project for a real business owned by a friend who recently launched her venture. At the onset, the absence of a backend posed a challenge. However, I came across tools like <a href="https://formspree.io/" target="_blank">Formspree</a> that allow for input capture and automatically send her an email when a user submits information. I also integrated <a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank">Calendly</a> for booking introductory chats, allowing users to stay on the site rather than redirecting them to another platform. This integration was easier than I had anticipated.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-muted m-2 p-2">
                        By utilizing <a href="https://formspree.io/" target="_blank">Formspree</a>, my website allows my client to receive an email when a web user hits "submit" to register for her course. Similarly, I integrated the <a href="https://calendly.com/" target="_blank">Calendly</a> UI into my website, enabling users to directly view my client's availability. Additionally, I used <a href="https://vimeo.com/" target="_blank">Vimeo</a> to upload two primary videos (each 25MB, even after reducing resolution) without having to upload the MP4 files to a local folder. I consider this achievement a result of working for a real business rather than just academically; it motivated me to seek solutions that supplemented the backend skills I hadn't acquired during my course.

                    <p class="text-muted m-2 p-2">
                        This innovation, I believe, is due to my client's unfamiliarity with web development coding. It provided me with the impetus to automate and enhance processes, ensuring she can smoothly operate and refresh the website.
                    </p>
                    
                    <span class="lead">Case 1: Efficient Newsletter Updates</span>
                    <p class="text-muted m-2 p-2">
                        I developed a straightforward JavaScript script, <a href="push_articles.js" target="_blank">push_articles.js</a>, that populates the "archive" section of the Newsletter Page. The input JS file, <a href="articles.js" target="_blank">articles.js</a>, is simple, with a few variables such as date, link, category, and description. Additionally, she only needs to save images in the "newsletter" folder with the date as the name (e.g., "2023-09-13.jpg"), which will automatically add the images to the archive section. This system eliminates her need to navigate complex HTML files whenever she needs to update the website with new newsletters.

                    <p class="text-muted m-2 p-2">
                        Another challenge was the regular (monthly) update of <a href="courses.html#logistics">group session starting dates</a>. For this, I employed Handlebars.js and created the backend-like functionality at the bottom of courses.html file. The input file she manages, <a href="path/to/course.js" target="_blank">course.js</a>, contains only the start dates for two group lessons. Instead of having her navigate through a lengthy HTML or JS file, she can simply update this one file to reflect new course dates, streamlining the process for her and making it user-friendly.

                        Taking into account her concerns, I proposed a pivot: to repurpose her existing Instagram content as a pseudo-newsletter for the website. This not only ensured fresh content on the website but also reinforced her primary messages to clients through multiple channels. Furthermore, recognizing the depth and quality of her recommendations, we incorporated a "Resources" page on the website. This page showcases her top recommendations, further establishing her credibility in the field.

            <p>
                The following ideas and projects were aspirations I had hoped to realize, but couldn't, due to limited time and expertise. My client plans to hire a professional designer/programmer in the future. As such, the items below will serve as a "to-do list" for the upcoming professional engagement.

                    <p class="m-2 p-2">
                        In our preliminary discussions, the client highlighted the potential benefit of a dedicated login capability. The intent was to facilitate the sharing of course materials, which she currently disseminates via email. Moreover, she employs Calendly to coordinate individual sessions with her clients. Infusing a members-only feature into the site would greatly refine these operations and foster a more seamless user experience.

                    <p class="m-2 p-2">
                        I drew profound inspiration from the elegant and minimalistic design ethos of the Harvard Business Review, especially its striking imagery. My attempt to replicate this style for an entry-level website inadvertently gave it a somewhat "undesigned" feel. The client and I explored potential Bootstrap templates, but due to pressing time constraints, we agreed to revisit this discussion in a later phase.
                    </p>
                    <p class="m-2 p-2">
                        Moreover, a day before the submission, I realized that we could have taken cues from her other website—an apparel e-commerce platform designed by professionals. This oversight is something we intend to address post-submission.

                    <p class="m-2 p-2">
                        Providing intuitive feedback post user-actions, such as subscribing to newsletters or enrolling for a course, is quintessential to affirming successful task completion. I architected a bespoke feedback page, `formspree_reply.html`, envisaged to render post-action given its local directory alignment. Disappointingly, the default Formspree affirmation page takes precedence over my tailored version. My design endeavored to offer a more individualized acknowledgment, echoing sentiments like, "Thank you. If our response is not received within two business days, please reach out at xxx."

                    <p class="m-2 p-2">
                        A more streamlined approach that I envisioned for my client, given her tight schedule, would be the automatic retrieval and display of content from her Instagram profile to her website. This would negate the need for her to manually copy-paste links, images, and excerpts from Instagram. An automated integration would greatly enhance the user experience and ensure consistent content updates. Regrettably, due to time constraints, I couldn't delve into the technical feasibility and execution of this feature. Its potential addition remains an aspirational goal for future iterations of the website.

                    <span class="lead">Navbar Accessibility Challenge</span>
                    <p class="m-2 p-2">
                        A pivotal aspect of web design is ensuring accessibility for all users. During my accessibility evaluation, I discerned that the &lt;a&gt; links were not emphasized when navigated via the Tab key. As a corrective measure, I transitioned from using &lt;a&gt; tags to &lt;button&gt; tags, enhancing the accessibility quotient of the site. This approach, however, faced resistance when applied to the navbar, specifically due to its intricate dropdown menu functionality. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to reconcile the complexities and ultimately couldn't ensure tab keyboard accessibility for the navbar in my version.

                    <p class="p-3">We have three versions of wireframes. The first version was based on an analysis of five competitors' websites. After completing my initial design, I added a new "Resource" tab to incorporate her existing resources (such as books) which I was unaware of at the outset. To maintain a limit of five pages, I incorporated "Our Story" as a subsection of the Home page. However, this made the front page appear overly filled with my client's photos, creating an impression of excessive self-adulation. In the final version, I removed the "Contact Us" page, which originally contained forms for newsletter subscriptions, course registrations, and booking introductory chats. Instead, I integrated this into the Home page to serve as an index, and moved the content to the bottom of the relevant pages. For instance, the course registration is now on the course page, and the option to book a free chat is at the bottom of the "Our Story" page. Lastly, since my client shares her newsletters on Instagram, I removed the "subscribe to my newsletter" feature, as readers can easily follow her there.</p>

                                        The key for the index page is to prominently display the action button ("Book the First Free Session") without seeming too pushy. Using the "Invest Like Aysha" page's two action buttons as an example; while the first button felt a bit over the top, the second one was aptly placed to suggest a free class. The page will kick off with a welcome message elucidating the importance of investing. The persuasive use of statistics on Corine Brecher's page, such as the percentage of women investing, was noteworthy. We will incorporate several testimonials, and a carousel layout will keep the page length in check. A brief introduction to "About Me" and "Service" (essentially, reasons to choose this service) will be provided, with the details being relegated to dedicated pages.

                                        It's crucial to strike a balance using images and icons, ensuring the presentation remains sleek without appearing cluttered. IWT's webpage employed an intriguing tactic by showcasing photos that capture genuine moments (like sharing smiles with clients or working diligently at a desk) which made the portrayal authentic and appealing. Integrating a YouTube video, reminiscent of what Corine Brecher executed, could engage customers who might not be keen on reading.

                                        Instead of adhering to the generic "Contact Us" page, we can craft a tab exclusively dedicated to a free initial call, accentuated with its specifics and a clear call-to-action button. This nuanced approach can easily replace the traditional "Contact Us" page, wherein we can allocate the email contact in the footer.

Recognizing a preference for audio/visual contents over text, several posts offer video messages supplemented by detailed articles. For enhanced user experience, popular posts are equipped with video playback options. Furthermore, posts are chronologically arranged, with the freshest content up top, complemented by a topic-based filter system like "investing," "well-being," "mission," and "collaboration."

                                        After comprehending financial well-being's gravity and juxtaposing the two learning pathways (self-study vs. supported learning), and being further inspired by information from contents found in the resource and newsletter sections, users can make one of three informed decisions:
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Subscribe to the newsletter.</li>
                                        <li>Engage in a free introductory chat with the coach.</li>
                                        <li>Secure a spot for the course.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>
                                        For subscribing and reserving a seat for the course, the website uses Formly. So when a user hits submit, the financial coach will receive an email. Similarly, for booking an introductory chat, the website integrates with the Calendly service to supplement our webpage’s lack of backend.

                    <p>
                        I have recently started building my business for women’s financial empowerment. The coaching program that I provide is called “Build Your Financial Wellbeing”, and it targets women of all ages and backgrounds, who want to take their finances to the next level and start investing. As a busy entrepreneur, my initial months have been spent in acquiring the first classes of clients, building my approach and tools for coaching, building a partnership with a wealth management company etc. I knew how important it would be for my business to have a compelling website. It is an essential part of the communication approach, and is like a digital business card that provides credibility to my business offering.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        Given how busy I was, I simply did not have time to start working on a website. And I knew that with my non-existent IT skills, it would be certainly quite an endeavor for me to build the website. It was therefore like a gift from heaven that my friend Mizuki contacted me and offered to build the website as part of her study project. I was so happy for this offer, and of the chance to work together again with my dear friend.
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        In the beginning, I was quite worried about the website project due to my past experience. Some years ago, I developed an e-commerce website for an online clothing sales business that I manage, and that project took months and was expensive. I had to rely on the support of an IT company, as well as the services of a consultant and designer. In the end, we managed to build a nice website, but it was a rather painful process. In my current situation, I would not have the ability to invest so much time to build a website, as I’m focusing on the build-up of the business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mizuki understood my concerns and took a different approach. She explained that she would be able to build a light website herself, based on existing materials that I had. She very quickly did an analysis of the competitor websites, to find out what was really needed, and what was the approach that the best ones had taken. Leveraging my existing flyer, she started very quickly to develop a first wireframes sketch of the website and prompted me with ideas for how to improve the current content. I was very impressed that it was possible so quickly to already have a draft website that looked great. We then started developing the structure further to ensure that the website would be easy to manage, give all the necessary information, yet remain light, easy to read and inspirational.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        One issue with the website development was that I did not have a very clear picture of how I would plan to engage with customers. We explored the idea of doing a newsletter based on book reviews, but I knew how little time I would have to create the content. In order for a website to stay interesting, there has to be new content relatively often, and I am afraid I would not be able to deliver. Later on, Mizuki proposed me various options. It was her idea to start leveraging the content that I am already producing on Instagram, and include it on the website. This is a great way to “re-use” content that already exists, and also ensure that my main messages to clients are seen ideally multiple times.
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        The website now includes all the main features that I need for the buildup phase of the business, and I’m very satisfied with the result. The website is my “business card”, it includes testimonials, my story, the “newsletter” content from Instagram, as well as information about the next course. The clients will be able to communicate with me (book a Zoom call or book a place on a course, or simply connect via email). Perhaps in a later stage, I will need to develop the website further, for example by having a backend and the ability for clients to login to a closed section of the website, where videos and materials would be available for course participants, as well as ability to accept credit card payments. However, this is currently not needed. I will probably also work with a designer to develop the style and pictures to be more concise.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am very happy about the outcome of the website, and forever grateful for Mizuki’s help. I would not have been able to do this without her.
