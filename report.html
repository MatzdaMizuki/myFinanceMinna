            <h4>Purpose of the website</h4>
            <p class="lead text-muted">
                This website offers Financial Well-Being Coaching for women. Minna, the financial coach, assists women in creating their "balance sheet", enabling a comprehensive understanding of their entire financial situation. This includes guidance on effectively managing monthly and yearly financial flows. Surprisingly, numerous women, even those in high-paying roles, have not embarked on their investment journeys and often find parts of their finances in disarray. This website primarily promotes a 6-week coaching program while providing useful information such as resources for self-study and a newsletter archive to rectify these issues and empower women towards financial independence.

            <ul>
                <li class="lead text-muted">
                    <span class="bold-title">First Page (Home)</span>
                    <p>
                        The initial page will greet visitors with a compelling message about the importance of investing, emphasizing the essence of financial well-being. This narrative also shares the financial coach's personal journey, particularly her realization of the importance of investment during her quest with her husband to buy their dream abode. Furthermore, several testimonials from satisfied clients will be showcased in a carousel format to keep the page concise. Action buttons, such as "Subscribe to Newsletter" and "Book the First Free Session", will be positioned strategically at the page's conclusion, ensuring it doesn't come off as overly aggressive.

                    <span class="bold-title">Second Page (Course)</span>
                    <p>
                        This section delves deeper into the courses tailored for enhancing women's financial management skills. It spotlights a 6-week course split into five detailed sessions, explaining the learning outcomes and setting expectations. A clear visual representation will highlight the five course modules using a grid layout. An accordion design is incorporated for in-depth information to ensure the amount of information doesn't appear overwhelming, while providing detailed information for those interested.

                    <p>
                        Catering to those who might prefer not to take the courses at least for now, this page offers an array of resources, from books to podcasts, bolstering independent financial management knowledge. Each resource is neatly encapsulated within a Bootstrap card design, with convenient links directing to platforms like Apple Podcasts, Spotify for podcasts, and Amazon for books.

                    <span class="bold-title">Fourth Page (Newsletter)</span>
                    <p>
                        This segment is exclusively dedicated to the newsletter. The financial coach offers daily insights, nudging women to be continually aware of their financial well-being. Recognizing a preference for audio/visual contents over text, several posts offer video messages supplemented by detailed articles. For enhanced user experience, popular posts are equipped with video playback options. Furthermore, posts are chronologically arranged, with the freshest content up top, complemented by a topic-based filter system like "investing," "well-being," "mission," and "collaboration." Upon clicking the "read more" button, users can see the details on the financial coach’s Instagram page.

                    <p>
                        After comprehending financial well-being's gravity and juxtaposing the two learning pathways (self-study vs. supported learning), and being further inspired by information from contents found in the resource and newsletter sections, users can make one of three informed decisions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Subscribe to the newsletter.</li>
                        <li>Engage in a free introductory chat with the coach.</li>
                        <li>Secure a spot for the course.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For subscribing and reserving a seat for the course, the website uses Formly. So when a user hits submit, the financial coach will receive an email. Similarly, for booking an introductory chat, the website integrates with the Calendly service to supplement our webpage’s lack of backend.

                    <p>
                        Harvard Business Review, which is the pinnacle of academic newsletters, inspires me for two reasons. 
                        Upon first impression, its clean and conservative design (white background, quiet font) paired with striking images caught my attention. 
                        we too opted for a minimalist color palette and sourced captivating images from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>.

                    <p>
                        The podcast “I Will Teach You to Be Rich” by Ramit Sethi offers financial advice in an entertaining manner. This is achieved by sharing relatable stories from couples who participate in his coaching sessions, complemented by the host's enthusiastic communication style. The website mirrors this engaging, story-telling approach with its punchy expressions, efficient use of space, and large-size images ensures readers engaged.

                    <p>
                        "Invest like Aisha" is helmed by a Swiss-based financial advisor catering to female clients. Her personal story is both heartbreaking and compelling: her husband tragically died in a car accident the day before she was expecting to give birth to her second child. Facing the uncertainty of maintaining her lifestyle, her experience highlights the critical importance of personal financial management.   It's a poignant reminder that even with a comfortable income today, we must always be prepared for unforeseen circumstances where we might be unable to work, necessitating our savings to sustain us. Moreover, her proactive use of YouTube videos, as seen in "watch my first class", provides an impression of her being action-oriented.

                    <p>
                        Using the web accessibility evaluation tool, <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a>, I've corrected all the errors to ensure strong color contrast and appropriate alternative text for images.

                    <p>
                        For the link descriptions, I have avoided using generic link texts such as “click here” or “read more.” Instead, I have opted for descriptive texts that clearly convey the purpose of each link. For instance, on the newsletter page, the button reads “Read more on Instagram.” Similarly, on the resource page, the button for recommended books states “View details on Amazon.”

                    <p>
                        For layout design, I've utilized Bootstrap's flex design with a column breakpoint for large screens. 
                        For instance, on the index page and the "Contact Us" page, an image and a paragraph are positioned next to each other, each occupying 50% of the space. However, in the mobile view, both the image and paragraph expand to take the full width. Similarly, on the "Course" and "Resource" pages, I've employed a card design. 
                        In the web view, three cards are displayed horizontally, but in the mobile view, each card expands to take up 100% of the width.
